# NetAdmin-Automation-Scripts
Scripts to automate some typical network administration tasks.

My first addition here was a basic Cisco Switch configuration written in Python. I used my own knowledge along with additional internet research to develop the script. Configure_Cisco_Switch.py was created on 18OCT24 but has not been run in a production environment. Updates will be provided as the script is updated and/or tested.
